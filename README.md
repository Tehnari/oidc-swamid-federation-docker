# oidc-swamid-federation-docker
This repository is test to create a docker for oidc-swamid-federation.

If very short: 
- At the moment it's better to do a clone for this repo
- You should use docker-compose (In ex. docker-compose up )
- How to work with it you'll find at: https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/#step-4-build-and-run-your-app-with-compose
- After you start it with docker-compose up , you should check https://127.0.0.1:8080

Point your Web browser at https://localhost:8080 and enter diana@localhost:8100 as you unique identifier and later diana/krall as username/password.

About scripts we are using here:
 - setup-oidc-swamid-federation.sh    ::->  Will work with main repo https://github.com/rohe/oidc-swamid-federation (Roland Hedberg)
 - setup-oidc-swamid-federation-v2.sh ::->  Will work with development repo https://github.com/sklemer1/oidc-swamid-federation (Steffen Klemer)
